## Predictive Analytics Engine

### Complexity Analysis

The engine analyzes goal complexity based on:

1. **Keywords**: Technical terms that indicate complexity
2. **Dependencies**: Number and complexity of dependencies
3. **Scope**: Size and breadth of the goal
4. **Integration**: Required integrations with external systems
5. **Security**: Security requirements and considerations

#### Complexity Scoring

```python
def analyze_complexity(goal_data):
    score = 0
    
    # Keyword analysis
    keywords = extract_keywords(goal_data['description'])
    score += keyword_complexity(keywords)
    
    # Dependency analysis
    score += len(goal_data['dependencies']) * 0.5
    
    # Scope analysis
    score += scope_complexity(goal_data['objectives'])
    
    # Integration analysis
    score += integration_complexity(goal_data['related_goals'])
    
    # Security analysis
    score += security_complexity(goal_data['tags'])
    
    return min(score, 10)  # Cap at 10
```

### Completion Time Estimation

Estimated completion times are calculated based on:

1. **Historical Data**: Previous project data for similar goals
2. **Complexity Score**: Higher complexity = longer time
3. **Team Size**: Available resources affect timeline
4. **Dependencies**: Blocked goals affect timeline

#### Estimation Algorithm

```python
def estimate_completion_time(goal_data, complexity_score):
    # Base time estimate based on complexity
    base_time = complexity_score * 2  # 2 days per complexity point
    
    # Adjust for dependencies
    dependency_factor = 1.0
    for dep in goal_data['dependencies']:
        dep_status = get_goal_status(dep)
        if dep_status != 'completed':
            dependency_factor += 0.2  # 20% time increase per pending dependency
    
    # Adjust for team size
    team_size = get_team_size()
    team_factor = max(1.0, 8.0 / team_size)  # Assume 8-person team as baseline
    
    estimated_time = base_time * dependency_factor * team_factor
    
    return round(estimated_time)
```

### Risk Factor Identification

Risk factors are identified based on:

1. **Security Keywords**: Terms indicating security concerns
2. **Integration Terms**: Terms indicating external dependencies
3. **Compliance Terms**: Terms indicating regulatory requirements
4. **Performance Terms**: Terms indicating scalability concerns

#### Risk Categories

- **Security Risks**: Authentication, encryption, data protection
- **Technical Risks**: Legacy systems, new technologies, performance
- **Integration Risks**: Third-party services, APIs, data migration
- **Compliance Risks**: GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, PCI DSS
- **Business Risks**: Market changes, competition, user adoption

### Resource Recommendations

Resource recommendations are based on:

1. **Complexity**: Higher complexity requires more specialized skills
2. **Scope**: Larger scope requires more people
3. **Risk Factors**: High-risk areas require expert attention
4. **Timeline**: Shorter timelines may require more resources

#### Skill Recommendations

```python
def recommend_skills(complexity_score, risk_factors):
    skills = []
    
    if complexity_score > 7:
        skills.append('Senior Developer')
    
    if 'security' in risk_factors:
        skills.append('Security Specialist')
    
    if 'integration' in risk_factors:
        skills.append('Integration Expert')
    
    if 'performance' in risk_factors:
        skills.append('Performance Engineer')
    
    if 'compliance' in risk_factors:
        skills.append('Compliance Officer')
    
    return skills
```

## Historical Data Tracking

The analytics system tracks historical data to improve predictions:

### Data Collection

- Identify common risk factors
- Optimize resource recommendations

## Machine Learning Integration

Future enhancements will include machine learning models for:

### Predictive Models

- **Time Estimation Model**: More accurate completion time predictions
- **Risk Prediction Model**: Better identification of potential risks

- **Success Probability Model**: Likelihood of goal completion

### Model Training

Models are trained on:

- Historical project data
- Industry benchmarks
- Team performance metrics
- External factors (market conditions, technology trends)

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Analysis**: Run analytics regularly to track project progress
2. **Data Quality**: Ensure accurate data entry for better predictions
3. **Historical Tracking**: Maintain historical data for improved accuracy
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Address identified risks proactively
5. **Resource Planning**: Use recommendations for optimal resource allocation
6. **Continuous Improvement**: Refine estimates based on actual results
7. **Team Communication**: Share insights with the team for better planning

## Integration with Development Workflow

The analytics system integrates with the development workflow:

1. **Goal Creation**: Automatic complexity analysis during goal creation
2. **Planning**: Resource recommendations during planning phase
3. **Tracking**: Progress tracking with predictive insights
4. **Risk Management**: Continuous risk assessment throughout the project
5. **Reporting**: Analytics reports for stakeholders

## Troubleshooting
