## Asset Organization Principles

### By Type

Assets are organized primarily by their media type to facilitate easy browsing and management.

### By Purpose

Within each type, assets are further organized by their purpose or use case.

### By Project/Feature

For larger projects, assets may be organized by specific project or feature:

```
assets/
├── project-a/
│   ├── images/
│   ├── videos/
│   └── documents/
└── project-b/
    ├── images/
    ├── videos/
    └── documents/
```

## Asset Naming Conventions

### General Format

`[project]-[feature]-[description]-[version].[extension]`

### Examples

- `myapp-login-button-v1.2.png`
- `ecommerce-checkout-flow-final.mp4`
- `report-q3-2025-v3.pdf`

### Versioning

Versions follow semantic versioning:
- `v1.0.0` for major releases
- `v1.1.0` for minor updates
- `v1.0.1` for patches

## Asset Metadata System

Each asset has associated metadata stored in a companion `.meta.json` file:

```json
{
  "id": "asset-abc123",
  "filename": "myapp-login-button-v1.2.png",
  "title": "Login Button",
  "description": "Primary login button for the application",
  "type": "image",
  "format": "png",
  "size": "1024x768",
  "colorSpace": "RGB",
  "created": "2025-09-23T10:00:00Z",
  "modified": "2025-09-23T10:00:00Z",
  "author": "Designer Name",
  "source": "Designed in Figma",
  "license": "Copyright 2025 Company Name",
  "tags": ["ui", "button", "login", "primary"],
  "usage": "Used in login screen and authentication flows",
  "variants": [
    {
      "filename": "myapp-login-button-hover-v1.2.png",
      "state": "hover"
    },
    {
      "filename": "myapp-login-button-disabled-v1.2.png",
      "state": "disabled"
    }
  ],
  "relatedAssets": [
    "asset-def456",
    "asset-ghi789"
  ]
}
```

## Asset Processing Pipeline

### Image Optimization

Images are automatically optimized:

1. Resized to appropriate dimensions
2. Compressed without quality loss
3. Converted to web-friendly formats
4. Generated in multiple resolutions for responsive design

### Video Processing

Videos are processed for web delivery:

1. Transcoded to multiple formats (MP4, WebM)
2. Compressed for web streaming
3. Generated thumbnails
4. Created adaptive bitrate versions

### Document Conversion

Documents are converted for web viewing:

1. PDFs optimized for web viewing
2. Office documents converted to PDF
3. Created searchable versions

## Asset Version Control

### Version Tracking

Asset versions are tracked in:

1. Git LFS for binary files
2. Metadata files for version history
3. Changelog for significant changes

### Branching Strategy

Assets follow the same branching strategy as code:

1. Main branch for production assets
2. Feature branches for new assets
3. Release branches for versioned releases

## Asset Access and Permissions

### Internal Access

Internal team members have access based on:

1. Role-based permissions
2. Project membership
3. Need-to-know basis

### External Access

External access is controlled through:

1. CDN distribution
2. Signed URLs for private assets
3. API access with authentication

## Asset Search and Discovery

### Metadata Search

Assets can be searched by:

1. Tags
2. Descriptions
3. File names
4. Authors
5. Creation dates

### Visual Search

Visual similarity search for:

1. Finding similar images
2. Duplicate detection
3. Style matching

## Asset Optimization

### Automatic Optimization

Assets are automatically optimized:

1. On upload
2. During build process
3. Based on usage patterns

### Manual Optimization

Manual optimization tools:

1. Image compression
2. Video encoding
3. Audio processing

## Asset Delivery

### CDN Integration

Assets are delivered through:

1. Global CDN for performance
2. Edge caching for reduced latency
3. Compression for faster loading

### Responsive Delivery

Responsive asset delivery:

1. Device-specific versions
2. Network condition adaptation
3. Progressive loading

## Asset Analytics

### Usage Tracking

Asset usage is tracked:

1. View counts
2. Download statistics
3. Geographic distribution
4. Device types

### Performance Metrics

Asset performance is measured:

1. Load times
2. Cache hit rates
3. Error rates

## Asset Security

### Access Control

Asset access is controlled through:

1. Authentication
2. Authorization
3. Rate limiting

### Content Protection

Content protection measures:

1. Digital rights management
2. Watermarking
3. Encryption at rest

## Asset Backup and Recovery

### Automated Backups

Assets are automatically backed up:

1. Daily snapshots
2. Versioned storage
3. Cross-region replication

### Disaster Recovery

Disaster recovery procedures:

1. Restoration procedures
2. RTO/RPO targets
3. Testing procedures

## Asset Lifecycle Management

### Creation

1. Asset creation workflow
2. Review and approval process
3. Metadata tagging

### Usage

1. Asset deployment
2. Performance monitoring
3. Usage analytics

### Deprecation

1. Deprecation notices
2. Migration paths
3. Removal procedures

### Archival

1. Long-term storage
2. Reduced access
3. Periodic review

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Asset Pipeline Integration

Assets are integrated into the development workflow:
