# Project Constitution Template

## 1. Core Principles

### 1.1 Goal-First Philosophy
All development efforts must begin with clearly defined, measurable goals that align with business objectives. Every specification, implementation, and task must directly contribute to achieving these goals.

### 1.2 Transparency and Accountability
All project artifacts, decisions, and progress must be transparent and traceable. Every team member is accountable for their contributions and commitments.

### 1.3 Continuous Improvement
The project must continuously evolve based on feedback, outcomes, and changing requirements. Learning from both successes and failures is essential.
