## ðŸ¤” What is Goal-Driven Development?

Goal-Driven Development flips the script on traditional software development. For decades, code has been king â€” goals and specifications were just scaffolding we built and discarded once the "real work" of coding began. Goal-Driven Development changes this: **goals become executable**, directly generating working implementations rather than just guiding them.

Instead of starting with implementation details, Goal-Driven Development starts with clear, measurable objectives. Each goal is carefully crafted with:

- **Clear objectives** - What exactly needs to be accomplished
- **Success criteria** - How we'll know when we're done
- **Dependencies** - What other goals or systems this relies on
- **Stakeholders** - Who cares about this goal and why

This approach ensures that every line of code serves a clear purpose and contributes to measurable business outcomes.

## âš¡ Get started

### Option 1: Persistent Installation (Recommended)

Install once and use everywhere:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Then use the tool directly:

```bash
goal init <PROJECT_NAME>
goal create "<GOAL_DESCRIPTION>"
```

### Option 2: One-time Usage

Run directly without installing:

```bash
python -m goal_cli init <PROJECT_NAME>
```

**Benefits of persistent installation:**

- Tool stays installed and available in PATH
- No need to create shell aliases
- Cleaner shell configuration

## Get started

### 1. Initialize a project

```bash
# Create a new project
goal init my-awesome-project

# Or initialize in the current directory
goal init --here
```

### 2. Create your first goal

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd my-awesome-project

# Create a goal
goal create "Implement user authentication with login, registration, and password reset"
```

### 3. List and view goals

```bash
# List all goals
goal list

# Show details of a specific goal
goal show <goal-id>
```

### 4. Plan implementation

```bash
# Create an implementation plan for a goal
goal plan <goal-id>

# Generate task breakdown
goal tasks <plan-id>
```

### 5. Track progress

```bash
# Track progress of goals and tasks
goal track
```

## ðŸ¤– Supported AI Agents

Goal-Dev-Spec works with multiple AI agents to help generate and refine your specifications:

- **Claude Code** - Anthropic's coding assistant
- **Gemini CLI** - Google's AI assistant
- **GitHub Copilot** - AI pair programmer
- **Cursor** - AI-first code editor
- **Qwen Code** - Alibaba's coding assistant
- **opencode** - Open-source coding assistant
- **Codex CLI** - OpenAI's coding assistant
- **Windsurf** - AI-powered IDE
- **Kilo Code** - AI development platform
- **Auggie CLI** - Augmented coding assistant

During project initialization, you'll be prompted to select your preferred AI agent. Each agent has its own strengths and integration capabilities.

## ðŸ”§ Goal CLI Reference

### `init` - Initialize a new Goal-Dev-Spec project

```bash
goal init [OPTIONS] [PROJECT_NAME]
```

Options:
- `--ai TEXT` - AI assistant to use (claude, gemini, copilot, cursor, qwen, opencode, codex, windsurf, kilocode, or auggie)
- `--script TEXT` - Script type to use (sh or ps)
- `--no-git` - Skip git repository initialization
- `--force` - Force creation even if directory exists
- `--here` - Initialize project in the current directory instead of creating a new one

### `create` - Create a new goal specification

```bash
goal create [OPTIONS] GOAL_DESCRIPTION
```

Creates a new goal with the specified description and automatically generates a corresponding feature specification.

### `plan` - Create an implementation plan for a goal

```bash
goal plan [OPTIONS] GOAL_ID
```

Generates an implementation plan for the specified goal, including tasks, timeline, and resource requirements.

### `tasks` - Generate task breakdown for implementation

```bash
goal tasks [OPTIONS] PLAN_ID
```

Breaks down an implementation plan into actionable tasks with assignees, due dates, and dependencies.

### `list` - List all goals in the project

```bash
goal list [OPTIONS]
```

Displays all goals in the current project with their status and creation dates.

### `show` - Show details of a specific goal

```bash
goal show [OPTIONS] GOAL_ID
```

Displays detailed information about a specific goal, including objectives, success criteria, and dependencies.

### `track` - Track progress of goals and tasks

```bash
goal track [OPTIONS]
```

Shows progress tracking information for all goals and tasks in the project.

### Global Options

- `--version` - Show version information
- `--help` - Show help information

## ðŸ“š Core philosophy

Goal-Dev-Spec is built on several core principles:

### 1. Goals First, Code Second
Every software project should start with clearly defined goals before writing any code. This ensures that all development efforts are aligned with business objectives.

### 2. Measurable Success
Each goal must have clear, measurable success criteria. This allows teams to objectively determine when a goal has been achieved.

### 3. Stakeholder Alignment
Goals should clearly identify who benefits from their completion and why. This ensures that development efforts create real value.

### 4. Dependency Management
Complex projects require careful dependency tracking. Goal-Dev-Spec helps identify and manage goal dependencies to prevent blocking issues.

### 5. AI-Assisted Development
Modern AI tools can significantly accelerate the specification and implementation process. Goal-Dev-Spec integrates with multiple AI agents to leverage these capabilities.

## ðŸŒŸ Development phases

Goal-Dev-Spec guides teams through a structured development process:

### Phase 1: Goal Definition
- Define clear, measurable objectives
- Identify success criteria
- Determine stakeholders
- Map dependencies

### Phase 2: Specification Creation
- Generate detailed feature specifications
- Define user scenarios and acceptance criteria
- Identify functional and non-functional requirements

### Phase 3: Implementation Planning
- Create implementation plans
- Estimate effort and timeline
- Allocate resources
- Identify risks

### Phase 4: Task Breakdown
- Break plans into actionable tasks
- Assign owners and due dates
- Define dependencies
- Track progress

### Phase 5: Execution and Tracking
- Execute tasks
- Monitor progress
- Adjust plans as needed
- Measure success

## ðŸ”§ Prerequisites

Before using Goal-Dev-Spec, ensure you have:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager
