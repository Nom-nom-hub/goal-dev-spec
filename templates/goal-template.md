# Project Goals: [PROJECT NAME]

**Project**: `[PROJECT_NAME]`
**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User goals: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user goals from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No goals provided"
2. Extract key objectives and outcomes from goals
   ‚Üí Identify: primary goals, success metrics, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill Goal Breakdown & Success Metrics section
   ‚Üí If no clear objectives: ERROR "Cannot determine success criteria"
5. Generate Success Criteria and Validation
   ‚Üí Each criterion must be measurable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Stakeholders and Impact Areas
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Goals have uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (goals ready for strategizing)
```

## üéØ Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT outcomes we want to achieve and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for stakeholders, not developers
- üìä Define measurable success criteria

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every project
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the goals
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating goals from user input:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the goals don't specify something (e.g., "user base size" without scale), mark it
3. **Think like a product manager**: Every vague goal should fail the "measurable success criteria" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - Target user segments and scale
   - Success metrics and measurement methods
   - Timeframes and milestones
   - Resource constraints
   - Business impact and ROI expectations

## Goal Breakdown & Success Metrics *(mandatory)*

### Primary Project Objectives
[Describe the main outcomes and value proposition in plain language]

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. **KPI-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "User engagement rate of 70%"]
2. **KPI-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Task completion time reduced by 50%"]
3. **KPI-003**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Error rate below 1%"]

### Success Criteria *(must be measurable)*
1. **Given** [baseline state], **When** [goal achieved], **Then** [measurable outcome]
2. **Given** [baseline state], **When** [goal achieved], **Then** [measurable outcome]

### Edge Cases & Constraints
- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does the solution handle [constraint scenario]?

## Stakeholder Analysis *(mandatory)*

### Primary Stakeholders
- **[Stakeholder Type]**: [Their goals, needs, and how this project serves them]

### Impact Assessment
- **Business Impact**: [How does this achieve business objectives?]
- **User Impact**: [How does this improve user experience?]
- **Technical Impact**: [What technical debt or improvements result?]

### Success Validation *(include if validation methods are specific)*
- **[Validation Method]**: [How to verify the goal is met, e.g., "A/B testing with 1000 users"]
- **[Validation Method]**: [How to verify the goal is met, e.g., "Performance benchmarking against current system"]
