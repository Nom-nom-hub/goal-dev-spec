## AI Code Generation

### Generation Process

The AI code generation process involves:

1. **Specification Analysis**: AI analyzes the specification to understand requirements
2. **Architecture Design**: AI designs the system architecture
3. **Code Generation**: AI generates code based on the design
4. **Quality Validation**: Generated code is validated for quality
5. **Documentation**: AI generates documentation for the code

### Template System

AI code generation uses templates for consistency:

```yaml
# .goal/agents/templates/web-api.yaml
template:
  name: "web-api"
  description: "Web API service template"
  language: "python"
  framework: "flask"
  
structure:
  - name: "app.py"
    type: "main"
    description: "Main application file"
    
  - name: "models/"
    type: "directory"
    description: "Data models"
    
  - name: "routes/"
    type: "directory"
    description: "API routes"
    
  - name: "services/"
    type: "directory"
    description: "Business logic"
    
  - name: "tests/"
    type: "directory"
    description: "Unit tests"
```

### Quality Assurance

Generated code goes through quality assurance:

- **Code Review**: AI reviews its own code
- **Static Analysis**: Automated code quality checks
- **Security Scan**: Vulnerability detection
- **Test Generation**: Automated test case generation

settings:
  default_agent: "claude"
```

### Environment-Based Selection

AI agents can also be selected via environment variables:

```bash
export GOAL_AI_AGENT=gemini
goal create "Implement user authentication"
```

## Prompt Engineering

### Prompt Templates

The system uses prompt templates for consistent AI interactions:

```markdown
# Generate Goal Prompt

You are an expert software architect and product manager. Your task is to create a detailed goal specification based on the user's description.

User Description: {{user_description}}

Requirements:
1. Create a clear, concise goal title
2. Provide a detailed goal description
3. List 3-5 specific objectives
4. Define 3-5 success criteria
5. Identify dependencies and related goals
6. Set appropriate priority and status
7. Include relevant metadata

Format the response as a YAML document that follows this structure:
```
title: ""
description: ""
objectives: []
success_criteria: []
dependencies: []
related_goals: []
priority: "medium"
status: "draft"
metadata: {}
```

Ensure the goal is specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
```

### Custom Prompts

Users can create custom prompts for specific needs:

```markdown
# Custom Code Review Prompt

You are a senior software engineer conducting a code review. Review the following code for:

1. Security vulnerabilities
2. Performance issues
3. Code quality and maintainability
4. Best practices adherence
5. Documentation completeness

Code to Review:
{{code}}

Provide specific line-by-line feedback where appropriate, and summarize overall findings.
Include actionable recommendations for improvement.
```
