# Goal Kit Practical Example

This example demonstrates how to use Goal Kit in practice.

## Step 1: Initialize Your Project

```bash
goal init my-awesome-project
cd my-awesome-project
```

## Step 2: Set Up Project Constitution

```bash
goal constitution
```

This creates your project's foundational principles that will guide all development decisions.

## Step 3: Define Your Goals

First, we'll look at existing goals:
```bash
goal goals
```

Then, you would create your actual goal files in the `.goals/` directory, but for AI assistants, you would use:

In your AI coding assistant (like Qwen Code, Claude, Cursor, etc.), you would use:
```
/goals Build a simple web application that allows users to manage their tasks
```

## Step 4: Clarify Your Goals

```bash
goal clarify
```

## Step 5: Develop Strategies

```bash
goal strategize
```

## Step 6: Create Implementation Plans

```bash
goal plan
```

## Step 7: Generate Tasks

```bash
goal tasks
```

## Step 8: Analyze Project Health

```bash
goal analyze
```

This command provides a comprehensive analysis of project alignment and consistency.

## Step 9: Begin Implementation

```bash
goal implement
```

## Using with AI Coding Assistants

The real power comes when using these concepts with AI coding assistants. In your AI environment (Qwen Code, Claude, Cursor, etc.), you would:

1. `/constitution` - Define project principles
2. `/goals` - Set your desired outcomes
3. `/strategize` - Explore different approaches
4. `/plan` - Design technical implementation
5. `/tasks` - Break down work items
6. `/analyze` - Check consistency and alignment
7. `/implement` - Execute the plan

The AI uses the goal-driven methodology to understand how to guide you through the development process based on these concepts, even though the slash commands themselves are interpreted by the AI assistant rather than this CLI.

## Understanding the Workflow

The CLI provides the structure and basic commands, but AI coding assistants can interpret the goal-driven methodology concepts to provide enhanced development guidance. The project directories created by `goal init` serve as the context for both the CLI and AI assistants to understand your project's goals, strategies, and plans.
