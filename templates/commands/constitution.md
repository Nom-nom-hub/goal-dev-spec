## Overview
The `/constitution` command creates a foundational document that establishes the principles, values, and guidelines for your project. This serves as the "constitution" that guides all project decisions and practices.

## When to Use
- At the beginning of a new project
- When establishing team culture and values
- Before major development work begins
- When you need to align team members on principles
- When creating long-term project guidelines

```
/constitution [PROJECT_NAME] [PRINCIPLES]
```

**Examples:**
```
/constitution user-authentication-system
```

/constitution e-commerce-platform "Quality, Performance, Security, User Experience"
```

## What It Does
1. **Establishes core principles** for the project
2. **Creates quality standards** and best practices
3. **Defines collaboration guidelines** for team work
4. **Sets innovation practices** and learning culture
5. **Creates decision-making framework** for technical choices
6. **Defines success metrics** for the project
7. **Generates constitution document** in `docs/[PROJECT_NAME]_constitution.md`

## Constitution Structure
The generated constitution includes:
- **Core principles** and project values
- **Quality standards** for code and deliverables
- **Collaboration guidelines** for team interaction
- **Innovation practices** for continuous improvement
- **Decision-making framework** for technical choices
- **Success metrics** to measure project health
- **Code of conduct** for project participation

## Constitution Development Process
1. **Principles Definition**: Establish core values and beliefs
2. **Quality Standards**: Define expectations for deliverables
3. **Collaboration Framework**: Set guidelines for team interaction
4. **Innovation Guidelines**: Plan for learning and improvement
5. **Decision Making**: Create framework for technical choices
6. **Success Metrics**: Define how project health will be measured
7. **Review and Refinement**: Ensure all team members align

## Best Practices
- **Make principles actionable**: Each principle should guide specific behaviors
- **Keep it concise**: Focus on the most important guidelines
- **Make it inclusive**: Consider all team members and stakeholders
- **Be specific**: Provide concrete examples when possible
- **Plan for evolution**: Allow for principles to evolve as the project grows
- **Share widely**: Make sure all team members understand and buy into the constitution

## Examples

### Startup Project Constitution
```
/constitution fintech-app "Innovation, Customer Focus, Technical Excellence, Team Collaboration"
```

### Enterprise Project Constitution
```
/constitution enterprise-crm "Reliability, Security, Scalability, Compliance, User Experience"
```

### Open Source Project Constitution
```
/constitution open-source-tool "Transparency, Community, Quality, Accessibility, Sustainability"
```

## Core Principles Examples

### Quality-Focused Principles
- **Code Quality**: Write clean, maintainable, well-documented code
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing ensures reliability
- **Performance**: Optimize for speed and efficiency
- **Documentation**: Clear documentation enables effective collaboration

### Innovation-Focused Principles
- **Continuous Learning**: Embrace new technologies and approaches
- **Experimentation**: Try new ideas and learn from both success and failure
- **Adaptability**: Be ready to pivot based on learning and feedback
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Share insights and learnings with the team

### Collaboration-Focused Principles
- **Respect**: Treat all team members with respect and consideration
- **Communication**: Keep communication open, honest, and constructive
- **Diversity**: Value diverse perspectives and approaches
- **Support**: Help team members succeed and grow

## Next Steps
After creating a constitution with `/constitution`:
1. **Share with all team members** for review and feedback
2. **Discuss and refine** principles as needed
3. **Use as reference** for all major project decisions
4. **Review regularly** to ensure continued alignment
5. **Update as project evolves** and new challenges emerge
6. **Use `/analyze`** to ensure project practices align with constitution

## Troubleshooting
- **Team disagreement on principles**: Facilitate discussion to find common ground
- **Principles too vague**: Add specific examples and behaviors
- **Too many principles**: Focus on the most essential ones (5-7 max)
- **Principles not followed**: Use as teaching moments and reminders
- **New team members confused**: Use constitution as onboarding material
- **Project outgrowing principles**: Schedule regular reviews and updates

## Integration with Other Commands
The constitution serves as the foundation for:
- **Goal setting** (`/goals`): Ensures goals align with project principles
- **Strategy development** (`/strategize`): Guides technical approach selection
- **Implementation decisions** (`/implement`): Provides decision-making framework
- **Project analysis** (`/analyze`): Serves as benchmark for alignment checks
