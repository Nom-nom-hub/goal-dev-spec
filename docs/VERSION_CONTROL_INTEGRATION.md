# Version Control Integration

This document outlines the advanced version control integration for Goal-Dev-Spec that exceeds spec-kit functionality.

## Git Integration Strategy

### Repository Structure

Goal-Dev-Spec projects use a mono-repo approach with clear separation:

```
[project-root]/
├── .git/                      # Git repository
├── .goal/                     # Goal specifications
├── src/                       # Source code
├── tests/                     # Test files
├── docs/                      # Documentation
├── assets/                    # Media assets
├── scripts/                   # Automation scripts
├── .gitignore                 # Git ignore rules
├── .gitattributes             # Git attributes
└── README.md                  # Project overview
```

### Branching Strategy

#### Main Branches

1. `main` - Production-ready code and specifications
2. `develop` - Integration branch for ongoing development

#### Supporting Branches

1. `feature/*` - New features and goals
2. `release/*` - Release preparation
3. `hotfix/*` - Emergency fixes
4. `goal/*` - Goal-specific branches

#### Branch Naming Convention

```
feature/user-authentication
release/v1.2.0
hotfix/critical-security-patch
goal/implement-payment-processing
```

### Commit Message Standards

Commit messages follow the conventional commits format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

#### Commit Types

- `feat`: New feature or goal
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `build`: Build system changes
- `ci`: CI configuration changes
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `revert`: Reverting previous commits

#### Examples

```
feat(auth): implement user login functionality

- Add login form component
- Implement authentication service
- Add JWT token handling

Closes #123
```

```
docs(architecture): update system design document

- Add new microservice architecture diagram
- Update data flow descriptions
- Clarify service boundaries
```

### Git Hooks Integration

#### Pre-commit Hooks

1. Code linting and formatting
2. Test execution
3. Security scanning
4. Goal specification validation

#### Pre-push Hooks

1. Comprehensive test suite execution
2. Code coverage verification
3. Security compliance checks
4. Documentation generation

#### Post-commit Hooks

1. Notification to team members
2. Automated deployment to development environment
3. Analytics data collection

## Merge Strategies

### Pull Request Process

1. Feature branches are merged via pull requests
2. Code review by at least two team members
3. Automated checks must pass
4. Goal specifications must be complete and validated

### Merge Commit Strategy

- `merge --no-ff` for feature branches to preserve history
- `rebase` for linear history on develop branch
- `squash` for small changes or fixes

### Conflict Resolution

1. Automated conflict detection
2. Clear conflict resolution guidelines
3. Review process for resolved conflicts
4. Testing of merged code

## Release Management

### Versioning Strategy

Semantic versioning (SemVer) is used:
- MAJOR version for incompatible changes
- MINOR version for backward-compatible features
- PATCH version for backward-compatible bug fixes

### Release Process

1. Create release branch from develop
2. Update version numbers
3. Final testing and validation
4. Merge to main and develop
5. Create Git tag
6. Publish release

### Git Tags

Tags follow semantic versioning:
- `v1.0.0` for major releases
- `v1.1.0` for minor releases
- `v1.0.1` for patch releases

## Goal-Dev-Spec Specific Integrations

### Goal Tracking in Git

Goals are tracked through:

1. Goal specification files in `.goal/goals/`
2. Git commits referencing goal IDs
3. Branch names including goal IDs
4. Pull request descriptions linking to goals

### Specification Versioning

Specifications are versioned through:

1. Git history tracking changes
2. Semantic versioning of specification documents
3. Release tags for specification versions
4. Changelog generation

### Collaboration Features

#### Goal Assignment

Goals can be assigned to team members through:

1. Git commit authors
2. Pull request assignees
3. Branch ownership
4. Code review assignments

#### Progress Tracking

Progress is tracked through:

1. Commit frequency and volume
2. Branch activity
3. Pull request status
4. Issue linking

## Git Workflow Automation

### Automated Branch Creation

```bash
# Create feature branch for a goal
goal git branch create --goal-id abc123

# Create release branch
goal git branch create --release v1.2.0
```

### Automated Pull Request Creation

```bash
# Create pull request for current branch
goal git pr create

# Create pull request with specific details
goal git pr create --title "Implement user authentication" --description "Closes #123"
```

### Automated Code Review Requests

```bash
# Request code review
goal git review request --assignees "developer1,developer2"

# Request specific type of review
goal git review request --type security --assignees "security-team"
```

## Git Configuration Management

### Repository Configuration

Standard Git configuration for Goal-Dev-Spec projects:

```ini
[core]
    autocrlf = input
    excludesfile = ~/.gitignore_global

[user]
    name = [Developer Name]
    email = [Developer Email]

[push]
    default = simple

[pull]
    rebase = true

[merge]
    tool = vscode

[diff]
    tool = vscode

[alias]
    st = status
    co = checkout
    br = branch
    ci = commit
    df = diff
    lg = log --oneline --graph --all
```

### Project-Specific Configuration

Project-specific Git configuration in `.git/config`:

```ini
[remote "origin"]
    url = git@github.com:organization/project.git
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*

[branch "main"]
    remote = origin
    merge = refs/heads/main

[branch "develop"]
    remote = origin
    merge = refs/heads/develop
```
