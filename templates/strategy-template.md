# Implementation Strategy: [PROJECT NAME]

**Project**: `[PROJECT_NAME]`
**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft
**Based on Goals**: [GOAL_REFERENCE]

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Analyze goals and identify implementation approaches
   â†’ If goals unclear: ERROR "Goals must be clarified first"
2. Evaluate technical approaches against goals
   â†’ Score each approach: feasibility, alignment, risk, effort
3. For each approach:
   â†’ Detail: architecture, tech stack, key components, integration points
4. Select optimal strategy
   â†’ Document rationale and trade-offs
5. Fill Strategy Details section
   â†’ If no viable approach: ERROR "No feasible implementation strategy"
6. Generate Implementation Roadmap
   â†’ Break down into phases with clear milestones
7. Identify Risks and Mitigations
8. Run Review Checklist
   â†’ If any critical issues: WARN "Strategy needs refinement"
9. Return: SUCCESS (strategy ready for planning)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Strategy Guidelines
- âœ… Strategy must directly support the defined goals
- âœ… Consider multiple approaches before selecting
- âœ… Balance technical feasibility with goal alignment
- âœ… Document assumptions and constraints

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every strategy
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the approach
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely

### For AI Generation
When creating strategy from goals:
1. **Start with goal alignment**: Every technical decision must tie back to goals
2. **Consider alternatives**: Always evaluate at least 2-3 approaches
3. **Think holistically**: Consider user experience, technical debt, scalability
4. **Common strategy considerations**:
   - Build vs. buy decisions
   - Technology stack trade-offs
   - Integration complexity
   - User adoption barriers
   - Maintenance and evolution
