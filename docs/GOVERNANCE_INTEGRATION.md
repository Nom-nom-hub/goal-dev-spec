# Governance System Integration

This document outlines the advanced governance system integration for Goal-Dev-Spec that exceeds spec-kit functionality.

## Governance Framework Overview

### Governance Layers

The governance system consists of multiple integrated layers:

1. **Project Constitution** - Foundational principles and rules
2. **Policies** - Specific governance policies and standards
3. **Processes** - Defined workflows and procedures
4. **Quality Gates** - Automated validation checkpoints
5. **Compliance** - Regulatory and standards adherence
6. **Security** - Security policies and controls
7. **Auditing** - Tracking and reporting mechanisms

## Project Constitution

### Constitution Components

The project constitution defines the foundational governance principles:

```markdown
# [PROJECT NAME] Constitution

## Mission and Vision
[Project mission and vision statements]

## Governance Principles
1. **Transparency** - All decisions and processes are documented and accessible
2. **Accountability** - Roles and responsibilities are clearly defined
3. **Quality** - High standards are maintained throughout the development lifecycle
4. **Security** - Security is integrated into all aspects of development
5. **Compliance** - All applicable regulations and standards are followed

## Decision Making Authority
[Decision-making hierarchy and authorities]

## Roles and Responsibilities
[Defined roles and their responsibilities]

## Change Management
[Process for making changes to the constitution]

## Amendments
[Process for amending the constitution]
```

### Constitution Management

The constitution is managed through:

1. **Version Control** - Constitution is stored in version control
2. **Change Tracking** - All changes are tracked and documented
3. **Approval Process** - Changes require approval from governance board
4. **Regular Review** - Constitution is reviewed annually

## Policy Management

### Policy Framework

Policies are organized by domain:

1. **Development Policies**
   - Coding standards
   - Code review requirements
   - Testing standards

2. **Security Policies**
   - Access control
   - Data protection
   - Vulnerability management

3. **Compliance Policies**
   - Regulatory requirements
   - Industry standards
   - Internal policies

4. **Quality Policies**
   - Quality gates
   - Performance standards
   - Documentation requirements

### Policy Template

Policies follow a standard template:

```markdown
# [POLICY NAME]

## Purpose
[Why this policy exists]

## Scope
[What this policy applies to]

## Policy Statement
[The policy requirements]

## Responsibilities
[Who is responsible for what]

## Procedures
[How to implement this policy]

## Compliance
[How compliance is measured]

## Exceptions
[When exceptions are allowed]

## Review
[When and how this policy is reviewed]

## References
[Related documents and standards]
```

### Policy Enforcement

Policies are enforced through:

1. **Automated Validation** - Quality gates check policy compliance
2. **Manual Review** - Human review of policy adherence
3. **Audit Trails** - Tracking of policy-related decisions
4. **Reporting** - Regular policy compliance reporting

## Quality Gate System

### Quality Gate Framework

Quality gates are automated validation checkpoints:

1. **Goal Validation** - Ensures goals meet quality standards
2. **Specification Validation** - Validates feature specifications
3. **Plan Validation** - Checks implementation plans
4. **Task Validation** - Verifies task breakdowns

### Quality Gate Configuration

Quality gates are configured in YAML:

```yaml
# goal-validation.yaml
quality_gate:
  name: "Goal Validation"
  description: "Validates that goals meet quality standards"
  rules:
    - name: "Title Required"
      description: "Goal must have a title"
      check: "goal.title != null && goal.title.length > 0"
    
    - name: "Description Required"
      description: "Goal must have a description"
      check: "goal.description != null && goal.description.length > 10"
    
    - name: "Objectives Defined"
      description: "Goal must have at least one objective"
      check: "goal.objectives != null && goal.objectives.length > 0"
    
    - name: "Success Criteria Defined"
      description: "Goal must have success criteria"
      check: "goal.success_criteria != null && goal.success_criteria.length > 0"
    
    - name: "Dependencies Identified"
      description: "Goal dependencies must be identified"
      check: "goal.dependencies != null"
    
    - name: "Priority Set"
      description: "Goal must have a priority"
      check: "goal.priority != null && ['low', 'medium', 'high'].includes(goal.priority)"
    
    - name: "Owner Assigned"
      description: "Goal must have an owner"
      check: "goal.owner != null && goal.owner.length > 0"
```

### Quality Gate Execution

Quality gates are executed automatically:

```bash
# Validate a specific goal
goal governance validate --type goal --id abc123

# Validate all goals
goal governance validate --type goal --all

# Validate specifications
goal governance validate --type spec --id def456

# Run all quality gates
goal governance validate --all
```
