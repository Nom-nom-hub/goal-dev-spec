# Implementation Plan: [PLAN TITLE]

**Plan ID**: `[PLAN-ID]`  
**Goal ID**: `[GOAL-ID]`  
**Spec ID**: `[SPEC-ID]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Timeline**: [ESTIMATED TIMELINE]

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse specification requirements
   ‚Üí Extract key tasks and dependencies
2. Estimate effort for each task
   ‚Üí Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific estimation question] for unclear tasks
3. Sequence tasks based on dependencies
4. Allocate resources and assign owners
5. Define milestones and checkpoints
6. Identify risks and mitigation strategies
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Plan has uncertainties"
8. Return: SUCCESS (plan ready for task breakdown)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT needs to be done and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid specific implementation details (code solutions)
- üë• Written for project team and stakeholders

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every plan
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the implementation
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this plan from a specification:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the spec doesn't specify something (e.g., "database design" without schema), mark it
3. **Think like a project manager**: Every vague task should fail the "estimable and actionable" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - Resource allocation and team assignments
   - Timeline estimates and milestones
   - Risk assessment and mitigation
   - Integration points and dependencies
   - Testing and quality assurance approach
