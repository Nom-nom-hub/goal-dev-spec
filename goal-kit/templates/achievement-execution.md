## Execution Philosophy

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) Approach

- **Red-Green-Refactor Cycle:** Write failing test → Implement minimal solution → Improve code
- **Incremental Progress:** Small, verifiable steps toward the goal
- **Continuous Validation:** Regular checkpoints to ensure alignment with objectives

### Parallel Execution Strategy

- **Dependency Analysis:** Identify truly sequential vs. parallelizable tasks
- **Resource Optimization:** Maximize team utilization through concurrent work streams
- **Critical Path Management:** Focus monitoring on blocking dependencies
