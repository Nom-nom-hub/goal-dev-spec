# Milestone Planning: [GOAL TITLE]

**Milestone Branch**: `[###-milestone-planning]`
**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Goal description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load goal definition from parent directory
   ‚Üí If no goal.json: ERROR "No parent goal found"
2. Parse goal scope and objectives
   ‚Üí Extract: timeline, resources, success criteria
3. Break goal into logical phases
   ‚Üí Identify: foundation, development, testing, deployment
4. For each phase, create milestones
   ‚Üí Ensure: clear deliverables, measurable progress, dependencies
5. Define milestone success criteria
   ‚Üí Each must be testable and achievable
6. Establish dependencies between milestones
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] if unclear
7. Estimate resources for each milestone
   ‚Üí Include: time, team, budget, materials
8. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Milestone plan has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If milestone too large: ERROR "Break into smaller milestones"
9. Return: SUCCESS (milestone plan ready for execution)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Create milestones that are achievable in 2-6 weeks
- ‚ùå Don't make milestones longer than 8 weeks without clear justification
- üìè Each milestone should have 3-7 specific, measurable deliverables

### Milestone Planning Principles

- **Progressive Elaboration:** Start high-level, add detail progressively
- **Balanced Workload:** Distribute effort evenly across timeline
- **Dependency Management:** Clear predecessor/successor relationships
- **Quality Gates:** Each milestone includes validation criteria
