# Goal Definition: [GOAL TITLE]

**Goal Branch**: `[###-goal-name]`
**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No goal description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: goal type, objectives, constraints, stakeholders
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill Goal Statement & Success Criteria section
   ‚Üí If no clear objectives: ERROR "Cannot determine success criteria"
5. Generate Resource Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be realistic and achievable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
6. Identify Key Stakeholders and Dependencies
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Goal definition has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove specific solutions"
8. Return: SUCCESS (goal definition ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT needs to be achieved and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no specific tools, methods, or technologies)
- üë• Written for goal stakeholders, not implementers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every goal
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the goal
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this goal definition from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "build software" without type), mark it
3. **Think like a manager**: Every vague requirement should fail the "measurable and achievable" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - Success criteria and measurement methods
   - Resource requirements and constraints
   - Stakeholder identification and roles
   - Timeline expectations and deadlines
   - Risk factors and mitigation approaches
