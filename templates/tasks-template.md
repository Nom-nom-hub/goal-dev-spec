# Task Breakdown: [TASK TITLE]

**Task ID**: `[TASK-ID]`  
**Plan ID**: `[PLAN-ID]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Todo  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Assignee**: [ASSIGNEE]

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse task requirements from plan
   ‚Üí Extract key acceptance criteria
2. Define implementation approach
   ‚Üí Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific approach question] for unclear requirements
3. Break down into subtasks (if needed)
4. Estimate effort and set due date
5. Identify dependencies
6. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Task has uncertainties"
7. Return: SUCCESS (task ready for execution)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT needs to be done and acceptance criteria
- ‚ùå Avoid deep implementation details (specific code structure)
- üë• Written for task assignees and project managers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every task
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the task
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this task from a plan:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the plan doesn't specify something (e.g., "implement authentication" without method), mark it
3. **Think like a developer**: Every vague requirement should fail the "actionable and testable" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - Acceptance criteria and success conditions
   - Dependencies on other tasks or systems
   - Required inputs and expected outputs
   - Testing and validation approach
   - Integration requirements
