# Goal Specification: [GOAL TITLE]

**Goal ID**: `[GOAL-ID]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Owner**: [OWNER]

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse goal description
   ‚Üí Extract key objectives and success criteria
2. Identify dependencies and related goals
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific dependency question]
3. Define measurable success criteria
   ‚Üí Each criterion must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous criteria
4. Fill Objectives & Success Criteria section
   ‚Üí If no clear objectives: ERROR "Cannot determine goal objectives"
5. Identify Key Stakeholders
6. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Goal has uncertainties"
7. Return: SUCCESS (goal ready for specification)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT needs to be achieved and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid implementation details (no tech stack, specific solutions)
- üë• Written for project stakeholders, not just developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every goal
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the goal
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this goal from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "improve user experience" without specifics), mark it
3. **Think like a project manager**: Every vague objective should fail the "measurable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - Success metrics and KPIs
   - Timeline and milestones
   - Resource requirements
   - Risk factors
   - Stakeholder expectations
