# Governance

The Goal-Dev-Spec Governance System provides a comprehensive framework for ensuring project quality, compliance, and consistency throughout the development lifecycle.

## Components

### Constitution and Governance Framework
The constitution establishes the core principles, roles, responsibilities, and decision-making processes for the project.

### Automated Compliance Checking
Automated compliance checking ensures that all project artifacts meet industry standards and organizational policies.

### Quality Gates
Quality gates provide automated validation checkpoints that prevent progression with incomplete or substandard work.
