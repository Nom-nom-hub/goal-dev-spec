## Quality Gates

### Quality Gate Configuration

Quality gates are defined in `.goal/quality/quality-gates.yaml`:

```yaml
quality-gates:
  - name: "Code Review"
    description: "All code must be reviewed by at least one peer"
    required: true
    validation: "presence"
    
  - name: "Test Coverage"
    description: "Minimum 80% code coverage for unit tests"
    required: true
    validation: "threshold"
    threshold: 80
    
  - name: "Documentation"
    description: "All public APIs must be documented"
    required: true
    validation: "presence"
    
  - name: "Security Scan"
    description: "Pass security vulnerability scan"
    required: true
    validation: "absence"
    pattern: "critical|high"
```

### Quality Gate Enforcement

Quality gates are enforced during:

1. **Artifact Creation**: Validation when creating new artifacts
2. **Pull Requests**: Validation before merging code
3. **Release Process**: Validation before releasing
4. **Periodic Checks**: Regular validation of existing artifacts

### Quality Gate Validation

```python
def validate_quality_gates(artifact):
    results = []
    
    for gate in quality_gates:
        if gate['required']:
            result = validate_gate(artifact, gate)
            results.append({
                'gate': gate['name'],
                'passed': result['passed'],
                'message': result['message']
            })
    
    overall_passed = all(result['passed'] for result in results)
    
    return {
        'passed': overall_passed,
        'results': results
    }
```

## Test Plan Generation

### Automated Test Plan Creation

Test plans are automatically generated based on:

1. **Goal Requirements**: Objectives and success criteria
2. **Specification Details**: User stories and acceptance criteria
3. **Technical Complexity**: Implementation details and dependencies
4. **Risk Factors**: Identified risks and mitigation strategies

### Test Plan Structure

```yaml
test-plan:
  goal-id: "goal-abc123"
  title: "Test Plan for User Authentication System"
  created-at: "2025-01-15"

## Code Quality Analysis

### Static Analysis Tools

The quality system integrates with static analysis tools:

- **Python**: pylint, flake8, bandit
- **JavaScript**: eslint, jshint
- **Java**: checkstyle, pmd
- **C#**: stylecop, fxcop

### Code Quality Metrics

Key metrics tracked:

- **Maintainability**: Cyclomatic complexity, code duplication
- **Reliability**: Error handling, exception management
- **Security**: Vulnerability detection, secure coding practices
- **Performance**: Efficiency, resource usage
- **Documentation**: Comment density, documentation quality

### Quality Scoring Algorithm

```python
def calculate_quality_score(metrics):
    score = 0
    
    # Maintainability (30% weight)
    score += metrics['maintainability'] * 0.3
    
    # Reliability (25% weight)
    score += metrics['reliability'] * 0.25
    
    # Security (20% weight)
    score += metrics['security'] * 0.2
    
    # Performance (15% weight)
    score += metrics['performance'] * 0.15
    
    # Documentation (10% weight)
    score += metrics['documentation'] * 0.1
    
    return round(score, 2)
```

## Documentation Quality

### Documentation Standards

Documentation quality is measured by:

1. **Completeness**: All required sections present
2. **Clarity**: Clear and understandable language
3. **Accuracy**: Correct and up-to-date information
4. **Consistency**: Consistent formatting and terminology
5. **Structure**: Logical organization and flow

### Documentation Validation

```python
def validate_documentation(doc):
    issues = []
    
    # Check completeness
    if not has_required_sections(doc):
        issues.append("Missing required sections")
    
    # Check clarity
    if not is_clear_language(doc):
        issues.append("Unclear language detected")
    
    # Check accuracy
    if not is_accurate_content(doc):
        issues.append("Potentially inaccurate content")
    
    # Check consistency
    if not is_consistent_formatting(doc):
        issues.append("Inconsistent formatting")
    
    # Check structure
    if not has_logical_structure(doc):
        issues.append("Poor document structure")
    
    return {
        'valid': len(issues) == 0,
        'issues': issues
    }
```

## Best Practices

1. **Integrate Early**: Set up quality assurance early in the project
2. **Automate Checks**: Use automated validation to enforce standards
3. **Regular Reviews**: Conduct regular quality reviews
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Refine quality standards based on feedback
5. **Team Training**: Ensure team understands quality requirements
6. **Metrics Tracking**: Monitor quality metrics over time
7. **Issue Resolution**: Address quality issues promptly
8. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive quality documentation

## Integration with Development Workflow

The quality assurance system integrates with the development workflow:

1. **Artifact Creation**: Quality validation during artifact creation
2. **Code Reviews**: Quality checks during code review process
3. **Testing**: Automated test execution and coverage tracking
4. **Pull Requests**: Quality gate enforcement before merging
5. **Releases**: Quality validation before releasing
6. **Reporting**: Regular quality reporting to stakeholders

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Validation Failures**: Ensure artifacts meet all quality standards
2. **Test Failures**: Address failing tests promptly
3. **Coverage Gaps**: Improve test coverage in identified areas
4. **Quality Degradation**: Investigate and address quality score drops
